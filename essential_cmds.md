git init -> initializing git in a repo (mostly been initialized)

git add -> adding stuff into git before pushed (git add . adds everything into git)

git status -> the git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

git commit -m "enter something here" -> it's like taking a snapshot at a certain point

git log -> gives a history of what you've commited and their timestamp
